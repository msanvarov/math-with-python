# Polynomials in Python

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to manipulate polynomials using the `sympy` library. Polynomials are mathematical expressions involving variables raised to powers, combined using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Concept

Adding polynomials involves combining like terms (terms with the same variables raised to the same power). This operation is fundamental in algebra and calculus.

Multiplying polynomials involves combining two or more polynomial expressions into a single polynomial. The process typically includes distributing each term of one polynomial to every term of the other and combining like terms.

Factoring polynomials involves breaking down a polynomial into simpler terms (factors) that, when multiplied together, give the original polynomial. It's a method used to simplify and solve polynomial equations.

Dividing polynomials involves finding the quotient and remainder when one polynomial is divided by another. This process is analogous to long division but with variables.

## Examples

The code includes examples of straightforward polynomial addition, multiplication, division, and factoring using the `Poly` class for more advanced manipulation, and exercises for understanding polynomial properties like degree and coefficients.
