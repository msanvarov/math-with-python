# Algebra Properties in Python

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates the associative, commutative, and distributive properties in algebra. These fundamental properties are essential in understanding and solving algebraic expressions.

## Associative Property

The associative property states that the way numbers are grouped in an operation does not change their result. For instance, in addition, `(a + b) + c` is the same as `a + (b + c)`. This property is demonstrated in the code with symbolic algebra.

## Commutative Property

The commutative property indicates that the order of numbers in an operation does not affect the outcome. For example, in multiplication, `a * b` is the same as `b * a`. The code shows how this property holds true in algebraic expressions.

## Distributive Property

The distributive property involves the spreading of a value over others. For example, `a * (b + c)` equals `a * b + a * c`. The code illustrates this property with symbolic expression expansion.

## Usage

The `main.py` file contains Python code using the `sympy` library to demonstrate these properties. Ensure you have `sympy` and `IPython` installed to run the code. You can install these packages using pip:

`pip install sympy IPython`

After installation, you can run the script and observe how algebraic properties are applied and verified.

## Examples

The code includes examples demonstrating each property. For instance, it shows how the distributive property is used to expand an algebraic expression. You can modify the expressions and experiment with different symbolic variables to see how these properties work in various scenarios.

## Conclusion

Understanding these algebraic properties is crucial in the study of mathematics. This code serves as a practical tool for visualizing and experimenting with these properties in Python.
